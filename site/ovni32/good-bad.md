# My experience

A list of my experiences with producers, technicians, and service providers for my boat.
**Diclaimer:** this is strictly *my experience*, for which I have factual evidence. It does not imply a general statement about the subjects involved.

## Good

- [Eletttroblu di Antonio Toso](http://www.elettroblu.com/): marine electrician
- [Onda Blu](https://www.ondablumare.it/): rigger in Alghero, Sardinia
- [Victron Energy](https://www.victronenergy.com/)
- [Antal](https://www.antal.it/): low friction rings, clutches
- [HongBa actuators](https://www.hbactuator.com/)

## Mixed

- [Eco-Worthy](https://www.eco-worthy.com/): products of excellent value, quality average (batteries) to low (flexible panels attachments broke soon), the best possible assistance on earth
- [Raymarine](https://www.raymarine.com): generally good products, but 
  * the [ST4000 tiller actuator](https://www.raymarine.com/en-us/our-products/boat-autopilots/autopilot-drive-units/cockpit-tiller-drive) failed often (5 in 5 years)
  * their ticketing system is often very slow and ineffective in replying
- [Yanmar](https://www.yanmar.com/): excellent engines, but their dealer network is not up to its standard
  * [SV Servizi srl](https://svservizi.eu/)
  * [Delta Mike Marine Supply](https://www.dmmarinesupply.com/)
  * [Sopromar](https://www.sopromar.com/)
  * central offices unavailable to account for mistakes by the dealers, no control over dealers
- [Marine cookers](https://www.techimpex.tv/): excellent after sale service, some problems in the product
- [TiberMast](https://www.tibermast.com/) rigging
- [Bluetti](https://www.bluettipower.com): good aftersale service, it broke soon

## Bad

- Shipyard in Monastir: absymal quality of work
- [Exide batteries](https://www.exidegroup.com)
- Interior painting by Italian carpenters: very expensive, not durable
- [MV Spools](https://www.mvspools.com/) fishing equipment
- [Nuku Hiva Maintenance](https://www.facebook.com/p/Nuku-Hiva-Maintenance-100093586062752/) (not to be confused with Yacht Services Nuku-Hiva, which is OK to my knowledge)
