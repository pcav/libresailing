# My experience

A list of my experiences with producers, technicians, and service providers.

## Good

- [Eletttroblu di Antonio Toso](http://www.elettroblu.com/): marine electrician
- [Onda Blu](https://www.ondablumare.it/): rigger in Alghero, Sardinia
- [Victron Energy](https://www.victronenergy.com/)

## Mixed

- [Eco-Worthy](https://www.eco-worthy.com/): products very cheap, quality average to low, the best possible assistance on earth
- [Raymarine](https://www.raymarine.com): generally good products, but 
  * the [ST4000 tiller actuator](https://www.raymarine.com/en-us/our-products/boat-autopilots/autopilot-drive-units/cockpit-tiller-drive) is not suitable for extended intensive use (I had 5 of them, all failed after 6-12 months)
  * their warranty is sometimes restrictive: if the serial number label peels off (not surprising in marine environment) they refuse to acknowledge the failure
  * I once sent an actuator for repair or replacement, it was damaged during shipment, and they initially refused to replace it; they changed their mind only long after
  * their ticketing system is often very slow and ineffective in replying
- [Yanmar](https://www.yanmar.com/): excellent engines, but their dealer network is not up to its standard
  * installation of electrical isolation wrong [SV Servizi srl](https://svservizi.eu/)
  * service done ineffectively (and of course too expensive)
    * [Delta Mike Marine Supply](https://www.dmmarinesupply.com/)
  * serious mistakes in engine major repair wrong [Sopromar](https://www.sopromar.com/)
  * central offices unavailable to account for mistakes by the dealers, no control over dealers

## Bad

- Shipyard in Monastir: absymal quality of work
- [Exide batteries](https://www.exidegroup.com)
- Interior painting by Italian carpenters: very expensive, not durable
