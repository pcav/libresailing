# My experience

A list of my experiences with producers, technicians, and service providers.

## Good

- [Eletttroblu di Antonio Toso](http://www.elettroblu.com/): marine electrician
- [Onda Blu](https://www.ondablumare.it/): rigger in Alghero, Sardinia
- [Victron Energy](https://www.victronenergy.com/)

## Mixed

- [Eco-Worthy](https://www.eco-worthy.com/): products very cheap, quality average to low, the best possible assistance on earth
- [Raymarine](): generally good products, but 
  * the ST4000 tiller actuator is not suitable for extended intensive use (I had 5 of them, all failed after 6-12 months)
  * their warranty is sometimes restrictive: if the serial number label peels off (not surprising in marine environment) they refuse to acknowledge the failure
  * I once sent an actuator for repair or replacement, it was damaged during shipment, and they initially refused to replace it; they changed their mind only long after
  * their ticketing system is often very slow and ineffective in replying
- [Yanmar](): excellent engines, but their dealer network is not up to its standard
  * installation of electrical isolation wrong []
  * service done by ineffectively
  * central offices unavailable to account for mistakes by the dealers, no control

## Bad

- Shipyard in Monastir: absymal quality of work
- [Exide batteries](https://www.exidegroup.com)
- Interior painting by Italian carpenters: very expensive, not durable
